# 📰 News Article Recommender System 🗞️

Welcome to the **News Article Recommender System**! 🚀 This project is designed to deliver personalized news article recommendations using machine learning techniques. By analyzing user preferences and article content, this system aims to curate a tailored news feed, helping users stay informed with articles that match their interests. 🌟

---

## 🌟 Overview

In an era of information overload, finding relevant news can be overwhelming. This project leverages **natural language processing (NLP)** and recommendation algorithms to suggest news articles based on user behavior, article content, or collaborative filtering. Inspired by the author's previous work, such as the [Hybrid Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Mohamed-Teba/Hybrid_Movie_Recommendation_System), this system aims to provide accurate and engaging recommendations. 📰📊

## 🎯 Features

| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧹 **Text Preprocessing**       | Clean and process article text (e.g., removing stopwords, tokenization).        |
| 📊 **NLP Feature Extraction**   | Use TF-IDF, word embeddings, or BERT to represent article content.              |
| 🤖 **Recommendation Algorithms**| Implement content-based, collaborative filtering, or hybrid recommendation models. |
| 📈 **Visualization**            | Visualize user preferences or article clusters with charts and graphs.          |
| 🌐 **Web Interface**           | (Optional) Build a Streamlit app for interactive article recommendations.       |
| 💾 **Model Export**            | Save trained models and vectorizers as `.pkl` files for deployment.            |

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset will likely include:
- **Article Metadata**: Titles, categories, authors, publication dates, and content.
- **User Interactions**: Views, likes, or ratings for articles.
- **User Profiles**: (If available) Preferences or demographic data.

*(Dataset details and source will be added once available.)*
